# Answer Generation Task
## Introduction
Automatic generation of answers is helpful in reducing human workload in answering commonly answered questions.
Here in this project, I have used the BART and Flan T5 models, which are generative models. These two models are best for text generation.

## Method
First training is done.
BART and FLanT5 are trained.
The file for training BART is quora-qa-bart.ipynb
The file for training FlanT5 is quora-qa-flant5.ipynb

## Stack Used
For the front end, I have used basic React, HTML, and CSS.
For the backend, I have used Flask.

## Detailed report is in the pdf.
