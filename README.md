# Answer Generation Task
## Introduction
Automatic generation of answers is useful in reducing human workload in answering commonly answered questions.
Here in this project, I have used BART and Flan T5 model, which are generative models. These two models are best for text generation.

## Method
First training is done.
BART and FLanT5 are trained.
The file for training BART is quora-qa-bart.ipynb
The file for training FlanT5 is quora-qa-flant5.ipynb
